# Customer Churn Analysis

This project explores consumer behavior and churn prediction using Machine Learning, Clustering, and Tableau visualizations. It combines data analytics, model building, and dashboarding for business insight generation.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory data analysis and modeling
- **Tableau** for interactive dashboards (.twb file)
- **K-Means Clustering** and **Random Forest** for churn segmentation and prediction

## 📁 Project Structure
